## About
Game of Clicks is a simple memory game built using React and Create-React-App. The rules are simple: When the game starts, click on any Game of Thrones character to get a point. Each click shuffles the order of the characters. Click on the same character twice, though, and your score resets to 0. Scoring is controlled via the state object.
